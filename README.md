## About me
My name is Krzysztof Tabor. I am a beginner, full of willingness and enthusiasm for new challenges as a Tester in the IT industry. I already have several years of experience in finding and analyzing anomalies occurring in a production plant in delivering elements from the warehouse to production. My goal is to develop test knowledge and technical skills in the field of testing. On this page, I would like to share all my experience gained during the course at Software Development Academy.
